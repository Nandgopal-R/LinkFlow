## Description
LinkFlow is a personal link management system designed for effortless syncing. A Go application continuously watches a local text file for changes. When a link is added or removed, the service automatically updates a central Neon database. A companion Flutter app connects to this database, allowing you to view your curated list of links from anywhere.
